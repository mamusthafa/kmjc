        <p>There is strong opposition to the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code. The initiation of a consultation process by the 22nd Law Commission of India to seek public opinion on the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is concerning. The Public Notice issued on June 14, 2023, allows citizens and religious organizations to submit their comments within 30 days (until July 13, 2023). It is evident that the Uniform Civil Code is not in the best interest of the country, as it poses harm not only to Muslims but also to followers of other religions. <br><br>

          While laws pertaining to trade, contracts, sales, penal laws, and general aspects of life apply equally to all citizens, matters related to family life, such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance, fall under the scope of personal law. The Uniform Civil Code disregards the diversity of religious practices and seeks to impose a uniform set of laws on all citizens. It is crucial to acknowledge that personal laws allow different religions in our country to adhere to their respective customs and traditions. <br><br>
          
          Certain political parties exploit the issue of the Uniform Civil Code for their own political gains. It is important for us to individually and collectively voice our opposition to the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code by submitting our views to the Commission. By filling in our personal details and submitting the provided draft to the address of the Law Commission, we can demonstrate our alertness as concerned citizens. <br><br>
          
          Please click on the following buttons to access the submission form and select one of the drafts provided to oppose the Uniform Civil Code. Write your name and submit the chosen draft to ensure that your objection reaches the Law Commission. <br><br>
          
          Note: It is important to remember that by submitting our objections, we are advocating for the preservation of personal laws and the rights of all religions in our country. </p>
